    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned we will use the work of Adkins and Liebeck to perform both optimisation and off design analysis. Let us start with the rotor blade optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method has been implemented in Python in the package called `tuduam`, i.e TU Delft Urban Air Mobility. Hence, when creating the input we have to keep in mind the [documentation](https://saullocastro.github.io/tuduam/)  </span> on what the functions expect. Feel free to roam around the documentation to see what other functionalities are offered by the package. Keep in mind however that the package is under active development.\n",

    "The design is initiated with the specified conditions of power (or thrust), hub and tip radius, rotational rate, freestream velocity, number of blades, and a finite number of stations at which blade geometry is to be determined. Let us define this in the next block\n",

    "## Defining the conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code below does not need explaining, however as previously mentioned we must take into account the [API documentation](https://saullocastro.github.io/tuduam/) .</span> Here it says that the blade parameter must be defined in the `Propeller` data structure. Furthermore, BEM analysis requires airfoil polar at a large range of reynolds numbers. `tuduam` relies on the user to input this data in the form of a path to a directory which contains all the polars. These files should be in the common format outputted by [xfoil](https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/). A tutorial on how to create this data has also been made which can be found in the course. Sample data for the NACA 4412 is readily available however in the `tuduam` repository. The NACA 4412 is shown in [Figure 1](#figure1)\n",

    "7. Compute the chord from Step 3, and the blade twist $\\beta = \\alpha + \\phi$.\n",
    "8. Determine the four derivatives in I and J, and numerically integrate these from the non-dimensional hub radius, $\\xi_0$ to the non-dimensional radius $\\xi$ = 1.\n",

The parameter that significantly changes is the freestream velocity, the only significant component left is the induced velocity caused by the rotor. Determining the value of the induced velocity is difficult, engineering judgement is used. [1] mentions an equation to estimate it however it is only reliable for higher flight speeds. Thus in our script we have assumed the freestream velocity to be 10 m/s.\n",

    "Furthermore it is important to consider how we should change our pitch control of the rotor.  As seen in [Figure 2](#figure2), the resultant relative wind will lay nearly in parrallel to tip-path axis.

We will now analyse the propeller at a singular offdesign conditions.

This will complicate the optimisation where we'll have to assign penalization when such an error occurs. Instead we'll use a  brute force method since the analysis is swift.
